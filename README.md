# Pacman DOODLE Game

Welcome to the Pacman DOODLE Game! This is a simple and fun Pacman game built from scratch using Java and Java Swing. It captures the classic arcade feel with easy controls and straightforward gameplay.

## What’s Inside?

- **Main.java**  
  This is where the game starts. It sets up the game window and kicks off the game.

- **GamePanel.java**  
  The heart of the game. It handles drawing everything on the screen, updating the game state, and listening for your keyboard input.

- **Pacman.java**  
  This class represents Pacman, the player. It keeps track of where Pacman is and how he moves.

- **Ghost.java**  
  These are the enemies! They move around the maze randomly and try to catch Pacman.

- **Wall.java**  
  The maze walls that block Pacman and ghosts from moving freely.

- **Food.java**  
  The little dots Pacman eats to score points.

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys to move Pacman around the maze.
- Eat all the food dots to increase your score.
- Avoid the ghosts — if they catch you, you lose a life.
- You start with 3 lives. The game ends when you lose them all.

## Running the Game

1. Make sure you have Java installed on your computer.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt in the game folder.
3. Compile the game by running:
   ```
   javac *.java
   ```
4. Start playing by running:
   ```
   java Main
   ```

## What’s Next?

This is a basic version of Pacman, but there’s plenty of room to grow! Some ideas for future updates:

- Smarter ghosts with better AI.
- Sound effects and background music.
- Multiple levels with increasing difficulty.
- A start menu and pause feature.
